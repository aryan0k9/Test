                        <p>Hello, Ocus Before I joined the cohort, I was into UX/UI design. Many of my friends were getting good gigs doing video editing. So, I always used to wonder how I can also get some good gigs. I had some experience with video editing before, but joining the cohort actually made me to sit down and devote time to the video editing. Ask any member of the cohort, The two classes that Martin took for sound design were the best. All three mentors were really helpful, from taking lectures to clearing up doubts in zoom chats. The remedial classes were organized for the beginners to cope up with the softwares, really appreciate that. By the end of the cohort, I'm capable enough to edit different types of videos and I feel I'm applying lot of stuff I learned while designing into video editing I received several placement offers, and Ocus assisted me in sorting out all my queries regarding the placements with a quick personal call. The networks I was able to create through the community are also absolutely priceless, and I'm so happy that Aevy and the team organized this cohort to inspire this community to learn together and form wonderful relationships. I just want to thank you Ocus, Martin and Varun and everyone from the aevy team to make this cohort possible.</p>

                        <p>I had the privilege of joining the Cohort and I can say with certainty that it has been a game-changer for me. The network I've gained access to, which includes India's top editors, content creators, and freelancers, has been invaluable. My life took a turn for the better when I was offered an internship at Aevy, made possible through the mentorship of great leaders like Varun Mayya, Kuntur Sir papa ocus, and Martin. Their guidance continues to shape my present and future. This investment has been life-changing and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to take their career to the next level.</p>

                        <p>This cohort was the YouTube industry break-in for me, it not only turned me into a professional editor but also
                            taught me how content industry actually works. Before this cohort I struggled with editing as the tutorials on YouTube were unstructured and the Return Of Investment I got from this cohort is at least 100x. Now I am not only good at editing, but also got to know how to
                            curate a good video, hook the audience better, mimic editing style of top YouTubers. Now I understand the power Visual storytelling which was taught by best in industry mentors Like Ocus, Martin, Varun Kuntoor.</p>
